            Just hours before the final presentation, Hamzat is unexpectedly confronted by Scott Greenwald, the executive chairman of <strong>Reality Hack 501c-3,</strong> the host of the Hackathon. Scott accuses Hamzat of being rude and without further explanation, expels him from the competition. Team Ball Lightning is left leaderless and disqualified, their groundbreaking project now in jeopardy.`,
            
            `<strong>Chapter 2: The Search for Truth</strong><br>
            Refusing to accept defeat, Hamzat starts a guerrilla internet activism campaign, gathering signatures for a petition to investigate Reality Hack 501c-3, the organization behind the hackathon. The investigation uncovers three main allegations against Scott: withholding Hamzat's passport, identity-based discrimination, and cheating to eliminate Team Ball Lightning's competitive advantage.`,
            
            `<strong>Chapter 3: The Qutrit Die Rolls</strong><br>
            Now, Hamzat must navigate through a series of challenges to clear his name and restore Team Ball Lightning's honor. Each decision you make will influence the outcome of this story. Will you confront Scott directly, seek support from the hackathon community, or find a way to present your project despite the disqualification?`,
            
            `<strong>Chapter 4: The Revelation</strong><br>
            Depending on your decisions, the story unfolds towards one of several endings. Can Hamzat uncover Scott's motives in trying to hack his hackathon and reveal the truth behind the disqualification? Will Team Ball Lightning's project see the light of day, bringing virtual ball lightning into our physical world?`

And in that moment, Hamzat knew it was not just about winning; it was about setting a precedent for forgiveness and humanity in the face of adversity.`;
