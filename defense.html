    `<strong>Chapter 1: The Dismissal</strong><br>
    Just hours before the final presentation, Hamzat is unexpectedly confronted by Scott Blackwald, the executive chairman of the hackathon. Scott accuses Hamzat of being rude and without further explanation, expels him from the competition. Team Ball Lightning is left leaderless and disqualified, their groundbreaking project now in jeopardy.`,
    
    `<strong>Chapter 2: The Search for Truth</strong><br>
    Refusing to accept defeat, Hamzat starts a guerrilla internet activism campaign, gathering signatures for a petition to investigate Reality Hack 501c-3, the organization behind the hackathon. The investigation uncovers three main allegations against Scott: withholding Hamzat's passport, identity-based discrimination, and cheating to eliminate Team Ball Lightning's competitive advantage.`,
    
    `<strong>Chapter 3: The Quantum Dice Rolls</strong><br>
    Now, Hazmat must navigate through a series of challenges to clear his name and restore Team Ball Lightning's honor. Each decision you make will influence the outcome of this story. Will you confront Scott directly, seek support from the hackathon community, or find a way to present your project despite the disqualification?`,
    
    `<strong>Chapter 4: The Revelation</strong><br>
    Depending on your decisions, the story unfolds towards one of several endings. Can Hazmat uncover Scott's motives in trying to hack his hackathon and reveal the truth behind the disqualification? Will Team Ball Lightning's project see the light of day, bringing virtual ball lightning into our physical world?`

    "ùïè": `<strong>Ending B (Community Support):</strong><br>The hackathon community rallies behind Team Ball Lightning, forcing the organizers to allow them back into the competition. Their presentation is a resounding success, earning them the grand prize.`,
    "+": `<strong>Ending C (Guerrilla Presentation):</strong><br>The unauthorized demonstration outside the venue captures widespread attention, leading to an impromptu review by the judges. Team Ball Lightning is awarded a special commendation for innovation and determination.`
